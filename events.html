                    The weekend under the motto "Let's Roll, Graz" was a successful one for the roller derby
                    community in Graz! On Saturday, September 25, the Dust City Rollers welcomed many new
                    interested skaters at their Newbie Day in the Sportunionhalle. Those interested were
                    able to try out different exercises and get used to skating on 8 wheels for a bit.
                    During a Q&A afterwards, the Dust City Rollers were able to present their club life,
                    and are now hoping for many new registrations.
                    Due to the purchase of some new rental equipment, which could be financed by the Sportjahr project,
                    the financial hurdles of full contact sports can now be reduced significantly
                    for many new beginners. <br><br>

                    On Sunday, September 26, the second part of the Roller Derby weekend took place.
                    During an open training session interested visitors could watch and get to know
                    Roller Derby better. We also wanted to make Roller Derby open to the public again,
                    after there had been no Roller Derby live event in Graz for over 1.5 years due to the pandemic.
                    The Dust City Rollers were trained by 2 experienced coaches from Vienna Roller Derby and
                    could take a lot of new impulses with them. The Dust City Rollers look back on a successful
                    weekend and are glad to have made the fringe sport Roller Derby a bit more visible in Graz.

                    The third Austrian Roller Derby Championships took place from November 30th to December 1st.
                    The event was hosted by the Fearless Bruisers – Roller Derby Innsbruck, who did an amazing
                    job organizing this year’s champs. We played four games on two days and managed
                    to take back the third place!<br><br>

                    The first game for the Dusties on Saturday was against the newest team in Austria,
                    SBG Knockouts Roller Derby. We have already shared the track with skaters from Salzburg
                    on different occasions, but it was exciting to play against an entirely new team.
                    Salzburg was a strong opponent, but we managed to win 144:89 in the end.<br><br>

                    The Dusties played the hosts, Fearless Bruisers, on their second game on Saturday.
                    Innsbruck were as strong as expected, but we were able to apply some strategies
                    we’ve prepared, even though we had to focus on defense mostly. Unfortunately we had
                    quite a few penalties on the first day in our team, but this changed for the
                    better on the second day. Innsbruck took the win with 179:75.
                    Thank you, again, for organizing such a great event!<br><br>

                    On the second day we played Vienna and Linz. We could feel that it was already the
                    second day and that we were a little exhausted. Unfortunately, within our team we
                    had a few health problems over the weekend including cramps, migraines, colds and
                    one of our strongest blockers – J. Butcher – wasn’t able to play at all due to illness
                    in the week before champs. J. managed to travel to Innsbruck despite everything
                    and joined their team on the bench.<br><br>

                    The first game was against Vienna Roller Derby and we enjoyed playing our big
                    derby sisters a lot! VRD play amazing and clean roller derby, which is why we had
                    a great time on track. The game ended 302:40 for Vienna Roller Derby. A few times,
                    we could implement some new offense strategies, but most of the game we had to focus
                    on defense. Fortunately, we could reduce penalties on the second day. For the first
                    three games, our guests from Ljubljana Kriss Me and Rea Stardust joined us as blockers
                    on track. Marica Mandona from VRD played all four games as a guest.
                    Thank you so much from the bottom of our hearts!<br><br>

                    The last game on Sunday was the one we were definitely most excited about.
                    The Steelcity Rollers from Linz were founded a few months before us and started
                    off on a very similar level. We always went back and forth with wins between the
                    teams. In the first year of champs, we could take home bronze. In the second,
                    the third place went to Linz, so, naturally, we were extremely nervous about
                    who would win this game! We immediately managed to get a head start and were
                    able to extend it up to around 30 points. However, shortly before half time
                    we played a disastrous jam that cost us our lead. Linz were able to score 25
                    points and there was a tie. We immediately took a time out and tried to get back
                    our focus. After halftime we started with a few strong jams and could take the lead
                    again. Still, it was close for the most part, so we had to really give our all
                    until the very end. We won the game 93:81 so we could take home bronze again!<br><br>

                    We definitely could have shown a little more confidence and actually apply more
                    of what we’ve been practicing this year, but overall we are very happy with our
                    performance and hope to improve next year. We’ve welcomed a few new blockers on
                    the team, as well as a new jammer – Johammer – who used to be a blocker before.
                    Special shout out to Lisilotta Rollgardina, who only started skating in February
                    this year, and already played as a blocker with us in all four games! Moreover,
                    we were very happy to have a great bench team at champs and all the other games this year.<br><br>

                    Our officials, Captain Robvious, Cloud Stripe and Confuzzed were also quite busy
                    officiating as referees all weekend, and so was Thea who took up different positions
                    as Non-Skating-Official. Thanks for your support!<br><br>

                    On our way back from Innsbruck we treated ourselves to some relaxing hours at the
                    spa. For next year, we have a few exciting things planned, so we hope to see you
                    at one of our bouts. For now, we wish everyone relaxing holidays and a happy new year!
