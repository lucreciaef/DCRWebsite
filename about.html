                <p class="content-text intro">We are the Dust City Rollers, a roller derby team from Graz, Austria.
                    <br>We stand for breaking the norms and breaking the binary.
                    <br>We want to defy gender expectations and create a supportive and non-discriminatory environment in sports.
                    <br>We welcome non-binary people and women to join our team!
                    <br>We want to spread the love for roller derby, a full contact team sport on quad skates and –
                    in our humble opinion – the best sport in the world!<br><br>

                    Dust City Rollers was established in 2016 as the third roller derby league in Austria.
                    Roller derby is a full contact sport played on roller skates, originating in the USA and is
                    mostly played by women around the globe.
                    The governing body of the sport is the Women's Flat Track Derby Association
                    (<a href="https://wftda.com/" class="content-links">WFTDA</a>).
                    Even though our league is currently not a formal member of the WFTDA, our team’s skaters consist
                    of individuals in accordance with WFTDA's
                    <a href="https://resources.wftda.org/womens-flat-track-derby-association-statement-about-gender/" class="content-links">gender statement</a>.
                    Therefore, all individuals who identify as women (regardless of their sex assigned at birth) or
                    outside the gender binary can join our team as skaters.<br><br>

                    Our league is skater owned and run, meaning we make all our decisions in a democratic
                    process and share all the work among our members according to the do-it-yourself (DIY)
                    principle. Every member can and should participate to keep the league running.

                    <h1 class="content-heading">What is Roller Derby?</h1>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        The game of Flat Track Roller Derby is played on a flat, oval track. Play is broken up into
                        two 30-minute periods, and within those periods, into units of play called “jams,” which
                        last up to two minutes. There are 30 seconds between each jam.<br><br>

                        During a jam, each team fields up to five skaters. Four of these skaters are called “blockers”
                        (together, the blockers are called the “pack”), and one is called a “jammer.” The jammer
                        wears a helmet cover with a star on it.<br><br>

                        The two jammers start each jam behind the pack, and score a point for every opposing blocker
                        they lap, each lap. Because they start behind the pack, they must get through the pack, then
                        all the way around the track to be eligible to score points on opposing blockers. A team’s
                        jammer may transfer their position to their team’s “pivot” (the blocker with the stripe helmet
                        cover) by successfully completing a legal star pass.<br><br>

                        The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.<br><br>

                        We train on-skates twice a week and have additional off-skates training (strength, agility,
                        fitness) one night a week. The trainings are prepared and led by our skaters.
                        We sometimes also invite guest coaches from other national and international teams.<br><br>

                        In addition to the trainings we also have regular organizational meetings to run the league.
                        As a team, we travel to away games to compete or host home games ourselves.<br><br>
                        Most importantly, we strive to be a supportive community and have fun together,
                        therefore we do all kinds of social activities together.<br>

                We run beginner courses once or twice a year. No prior knowledge is required, we teach you all the necessary skills,
                from how to skate to how the game works. To become a team skater, you must be over 18 and identify as female,
                non-binary or gender-non-conforming. We welcome all individuals over 18 to join us as officials (skating or non-skating).
                We organize Newbie-Days, where you can try out roller derby before signing up for the beginner course.<br>
                Contact us or follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dustcityrollers/" class="content-links">Facebook</a> or
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dustcityrollers/" class="content-links">Instagram</a> to get updates on the next Newbie Day.

                We usually have our on-skates trainings on Sunday afternoons and Wednesday evenings.
                We also offer off-skates training (strength, agility, fitness) on Thursdays.

            <p>
                Skaters (players) need quad skates and protective gear (wrist guards, elbow pads, knee pads, mouth guards, and helmet).
                We can lend you everything during the Newbie Day, where you can try out skating.
                We have sponsorship deals with rollerderbyhouse.eu and suckerpunchskateshop.com, where you can order equipment at a reduced
                rate when you join us. We are happy to help new members with advice on their first time purchase,
                so they can benefit from our experience. Sometimes our skaters also have used gear to sell. Do not hesitate to ask us about it!

            <p>
                As with many roller derby teams, our name is a wordplay on something representative for our hometown.
                We are located in Graz/Austria, which is infamously known for its fine dust pollution due to its geographical basin location.
                Of course, we are not happy about the pollution and don’t mean to celebrate it with our name, but rather understand it
                as a snide remark on the situation.<br>
                Our team cheer is “Eat my Dust!”.
